# Hello ðŸ‘‹

## Long story short
I have been a backend web developer for 5 years, originally working with PHP, and transitioning to Node.js for over a year now.

## Open source
I contribute to open source projects, particularly to the [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/) ecosystem. 
I believe it's one of the best ways to improve because open source usually involves very talented and experienced developers (and therefore some pretty tough code reviews). 
Additionally, it allows me to work on very technical projects that are not always dealt with in a corporate setting.

I've also made several contributions to the NodeSecure project, specifically the [js-x-ray](https://github.com/NodeSecure/js-x-ray) component, which analyzes a JavaScript AST to detect malicious patterns.

For fun, I've submitted [two PRs to TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajean-michelet+) because I enjoy the science and technique involved in compilers/interpreters. 

## Personal interests
I am very interested in critical thinking and particularly psychology, as it sits at the intersection of social sciences and *hard* sciences. It's crucial for understanding the world and fight our cognitive biases that can eventually lead us down dark paths. I'd like to use my technical skills to contribute to its development once I'm sufficiently trained in the subject. I have already started with https://memoriboost.com (currently only in French), which helps students optimize their learning based on the most serious scientific recommendations.
